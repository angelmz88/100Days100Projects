### Do you know?
Did you know that using "Hello, World!" It dates back to the 1970s. One of the first documented examples of this simple program is found in the book "The C Programming Language" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, which is widely considered a foundational text in C programming. In that book, the program "Hello, World!" was used to demonstrate how to print text to the screen in the C language.
